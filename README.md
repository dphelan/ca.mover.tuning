# Mover Tuning

## About

This is a simple [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) plugin that will let you fine-tune the operation of the [mover](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/manual/additional-settings/#mover).

- On scheduled runs of mover
    - Only actually move file(s) if the the cache drive is getting full (selectable threshold)
    - Optionally don't move if a parity check / rebuild is already in-progress
- Optional ability to completely disable the scheduled runs of mover
- Manually executed runs of mover ("Move Now" button) can either follow the rules for schedules, or always move all files

## Installation

You can download and install plugins with [Community Apps](https://unraid.net/community/apps/c/plugins).

## Configuration

You'll find its settings within Settings - [Scheduler](https://docs.unraid.net/unraid-os/manual/additional-settings/#scheduler).

## Usage

After installation, the default settings are set so that there is no difference from Unraid's normal mover operations.

See the [_Mover Tuning_ thread on the Unraid support forum](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/70783-plugin-mover-tuning/) for more details and discussions.
